# Investment Portfolio Tracker

## Description

This project showcases proficiency in working with APIs and data retrieval using the requests library in Python. The Investment Portfolio Tracker is a tool that interacts with external data sources to fetch financial information, specifically the live Bitcoin price, and enables users to monitor their investment portfolio's performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- **API Integration:** Gained experience in connecting to external APIs, retrieving real-time financial data, and incorporating it into the application to provide up-to-date information.

- **Data Retrieval:** Developed skills in processing and parsing JSON data obtained from the Coindesk API, extracting relevant information, and presenting it to the user.

- **Python Programming:** Strengthened Python programming skills by implementing functions for data manipulation, calculations, and file handling.

- **Investment Tracking:** Acquired knowledge in building a basic investment tracker that calculates the total value of the portfolio.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the Investment Portfolio Tracker.
2. The script will fetch the live Bitcoin price from the Coindesk API and display it in USD.
3. Enter the number of exchanges in your portfolio when prompted.
4. For each exchange, enter the balance of your investment in USD.
5. The script will calculate and display the total value of your portfolio in USD and BTC (Bitcoin).
6. The portfolio's balance history, along with the date and values, will be saved in the `balancehistory.txt` file for future reference.

Please note that this script provides a basic functionality to track the value of the investment portfolio. You can extend and modify the script to include additional features like tracking multiple cryptocurrencies, historical data retrieval, and graphical visualization of portfolio performance.
